This repo contains the code I used for Lab-2 of the MTI805 class at ETS Montreal during the 2025 Winter session.

`stitching_detailed.py` is the script found on OpenCV's repo (in [/samples/python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.x/samples/python)) with a fully configurable stitching pipeline. It requires **OpenCV version >= 4.0** to work properly.

`main.py` is the script I made in order to use this pipeline with differents sets of images.

`keypoints_matches.py` is the script I used in order to draw the best keypoints and their matches on selected images.

`assets` containes the source images used to produce the results presented in the report.

`matches` contains several matching case examples.

`results` contains the result images presented in the report.
